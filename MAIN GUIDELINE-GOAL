I have to pass this exam with the MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
The folder "repositoryX" contains already the code necessary to reach minimum requirements, the problem is that it has more than that, fulfilling many bonus points.

#The goal
The goal is to create an almost copy of repositoryX, inside working-copy folder, but without the unecessary code.
