MERGED CUT PLAN — PASS 1 (SAFE SCREENING / ZERO‑RISK)

Goal
- Do a first screening of obvious useless information inside repositoryX.
- Do NOT change anything that could affect build/run behavior.
- No code edits, no CMake edits, no script edits in this pass.

1) Remove only generated / local environment clutter
Delete (or ensure they are NOT committed):
- build/
- CMakeFiles/
- bin/
- results/
- *.o, *.obj, *.a, *.so, *.dll, *.exe
- IDE folders: .idea/, .vscode/
- OS trash: .DS_Store, Thumbs.db

Action
- Add/extend a .gitignore to ignore all the above.

Why safe
- These are build outputs/editor configs. Removing them cannot break the project logic.

2) Keep everything that could be part of the build or runtime
DO NOT delete in Pass 1:
- D1-code/   (even if it’s not needed long-term)
- D2-code/
- mmio/
- CMakeLists.txt (unchanged)
- script/ (unchanged)
- strong.pbs / weak.pbs (if present)
- matrices/ or any sample .mtx inputs
- any README / docs (unchanged)

Why
- D1 may still be referenced by CMake/scripts. Keeping it avoids accidental breakage.

3) Optional-safe: remove “dead artifacts” ONLY if clearly unrelated
You may remove ONLY if you are sure they are not referenced by README/scripts:
- old binaries copied around outside bin/
- old results logs that are clearly obsolete
- duplicate archives/zips
- random screenshots

Rule of thumb
- If unsure → keep for now. This is a screening pass.

4) Smoke test after Pass 1
After cleaning, run the same build/run you already know works:
- Configure + build with CMake as usual
- Run a quick MPI test (e.g., mpirun -np 2) using the same matrix as before

Pass criterion
- Behavior/output matches what you had before the screening.

WHAT WE POSTPONE (NOT NOW, TO AVOID RISK)

Pass 2 (medium risk; only after Pass 1 is green)
- Remove D1-code/ for real
- Remove D1-only scripts (runreg*, seqreg*, etc.)
- Update CMakeLists.txt to build only D2 targets
- If D2 reuses any D1 helpers, migrate minimal code into D2 (no dependency on D1 folder)

Pass 3 (higher risk; only after Pass 2 is green)
- Simplify spmv_mpi.cpp (remove OpenMP paths / extra logging/metrics if not required)
- Standardize program output and simplify strong/weak scripts accordingly

END
